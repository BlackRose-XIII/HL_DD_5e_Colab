They are elf wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. \n\nRESTRICTION: ELVES ONLY \n\nOnly elves and half-elves can choose the bladesinger arcane tradition. In the world of Faerfln, elves closely guard the secrets of bladesinging. \n\nYour DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction reflects the story of bladesingers in the Forgotten Realms, but it might not apply to your DM&apos;s setting or your DM&apos;s version of the Realms." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people and lands." uniqueness="unique">
