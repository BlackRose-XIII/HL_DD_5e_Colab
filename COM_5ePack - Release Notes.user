</ul> 
<strong>Enhancements and Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>BACKGROUNDS (PHB) Changed background special abilities Uniqueness flag to 'No' enabling the special abilities to display on the Backgrounds tab as well as the Specials tab.</li>
<li>RACE (Tiefling) The official Tiefling was unable to link to learn Hellish Rebuke as part of Infernal Legacy as the spell was not included in the SRD. We have therefore created a community copy of Tiefling and linked the spell correctly. Users who have made Tiefling characters previously may need to update their characters to use the new Tiefling 'thing' within Hero Labs. This can be done by simply "re-selecting" the Tiefling race on the "Race" tab after opening up your character.</li>
<li>The (Not Really) Complete Tome of Spells - 470 new spells all assigned to classes. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>BACKGROUNDS (ab5CPosPri, ab5CRetain, ab5CBadRep) These special abilities were created as Background Custom Abilities instead of General Abilities. Changed these in line with everything else which fixed their display issue.</li>

<li>FEAT (Medium Armor Master) - Corrected pre-requisite check to correctly check for Medium Armor Proficiency.</li>
<li>FEAT (War Caster) - Now correctly recognizing the Warlock class in the pre-requisite check.</li>
<li>RACE (Obsolete Human Variant) - The original community Human Variant was made obsolete on 24/02/16 with the release of an official Human Variant. ra5CHumVar was made Obsolete but this caused validation errors as the Human still thought a sub-race had to be picked. Have therefore removed 'ra5CHumVar' resolving the validation error.</li>
<li>SPELL (Chromatic Orb) - Removed this from *Hidden, now available to characters again. </li>
<li>DEITIES (Drow Pantheon) - Things ID of drow deities were changed to follow naming convention.</li>
