  <thing id="r5CUrsine" name="Ursine" description="Nestled at the base of a large mountain range, the Ursine village lies at the edge of an ever-present maelstrom, the Gelid Vortex, which hovers just beyond the protective rim of mountains. Battling through frigid winters, the Ursine are a hardy race with centuries of tradition to call back upon.\n\nAnimalistic\nThough many see the Ursine as intelligent bears, there are many differences between the Ursine and their savage cousin. A fully grown Ursine is much smaller than a bear and is as nimble on his hind legs as he is on all four. Outsiders may find it hard to believe, but the rough Ursine have much more restrain and self-control than the beasts they are often mistaken for, though some suspect this is a result of their lack of need to hibernate. \n\nStrong and Tough\nYears of living in the rough northern lands of the Freljord have made the Ursine tough. The harsh winters at the base of a mountain range often lead to lack of food, requiring many of the Ursine to survive off of the tough plant life native to the Freljord. Though many of the other races have trouble with the low temperatures of the north, the Ursine are barely affected by the cold, instead kept warm by their fur coats.\n\nHomeland Traditions\nMany Ursine choose to wander the world in their formative years, curious about the state of the rest of the world. However, most of which who go out often return to their home, either because they miss their home or their curiosity has been sated. As a result of the journeying many Ursine do, the ageold traditions of the Ursine are an eclectic mix, with bits and pieces taken from the other cultures of the land. \n\nHistory of War\nIn the past, long ago, the Ursine were a warrior race, savage, fierce, and disciplined. However, once peace arrived at Freljord, the Ursine settled down and much of their war-like temperament was lost. \n\nThis changed once Volibear, the town shaman, had visions of a brutul conflict. Journeying to the top of the mountain, he was touched by an unnatural bolt of lightning. Journeying to his village, he roused his people and began returning them to the state of their fore-fathers, proud warriors.\n\nUrsine Names\nUrsine name their young based on what they want them to achieve as adults. An aggressive, war-like Ursine may give his son a rough, cacophonous name while another might name her son after the hero of an Ursine folk tale.\n\nMale Ursine Names: Arrus, Anrun, Callun, Deruhs, Leneth, Marukus, Olland, Rutushush, Veeros, Wlaren \nFemale Ursine Names: Arsa, Belara, Dalara, Edulla, Hoinda, Ollinde, Nacura, Neruna, Warra\n\nSource: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ttoyMfsaC7M01uTHFfYWhFNlU/view?usp=sharing" compset="Race">

  <thing id="r5CSharMin" name="Shardmind" description="Crystalline Constructs\nShardminds are beings made of tiny crystal fragments held together by intense focus. This focus allows them to shape their bodies to look humanoid, but must be maintained at all times. Some are so skilled at controlling tiny crystal fragments that their skin appears to be almost human-like. When a Shardmind is stunned or unconscious, some fragments float away into orbit around him until he has the chance to regain control.\n\nEclectic Minds\nThe psionic power that a Shardmind possesses comes from the fact that, in essence, he is a fragment of pure thought. Some of them can be very rational and calculating, but others are empathetic, timid, or hot-tempered. However, at the same time they all approach life like newborn babes, embracing the experiences around them and attempting to incorporate the vast stores of knowledge now open to them. \n\nPieces of a Whole\nAlthough there are various tales of the origin of Shardminds, one thing that they all agree on is that they all came from the same entity, an ancient construct of great power that fell to pieces in a catastrophe that they have dubbed The Fracturing. Some say that they were once part of a great gate that was created to connect across unknown worlds. Others believe they were an entity created by the gods to deliver justice. Whatever they believe about their origin, they all know that each Shardmind is a piece of the thought of that construct, and all of them have a longing to see themselves become whole again.\n\nShardmind Names\nAs Shardminds are constructs given life through psionic power, they aren’t bound by gender the way that most races are. Therefore, all of their names are gender-neutral. \n\nShardmind Names: Amata, Arshaka, Arwia, Balashi, Bashanu, Belessunu, Dipana, Erishti, Eshunu, Hunzu, Iltani, Ishmae, Kuaya, Kubaba, Kuri, Manishtu, Naran, Nuraya, Seluku, Tabni, Ubashu, Utau, Zakiti\n\nSource: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ttoyMfsaC7M01uTHFfYWhFNlU/view?usp=sharing" compset="Race">
