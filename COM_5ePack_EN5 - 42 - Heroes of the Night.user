  <thing id="c5CPthWolf" name="Path of the Wolfsblood" description="All barbarians must learn to master their rage; the Wolfsblood are those whose wrath stems from an inborn or inflicted lycanthropic curse. Through this path of training, noble Wolfsbloods turn this evil power to their advantage, while the worst follow in their ancestors’ bloody footsteps. Only those who have taken on the curse of lycanthropy may adopt this path; it is most commonly passed on from another Wolfsblood in a blood-soaked rite of passage.\n\nOther types of lycanthropic barbarians are found in legend, such as the Bear-kin, the Boarblood, and the Black Stripes. If any of them still\nremain, they follow their own traditions. \n\nThe saving throw DC for your Moonstruck and Cursed Bite abilities is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. The restriction\nagainst concentrating on spells while raging does not apply to your Moonstruck or Cursed Bite features." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

Transforming them back requires an action, and the transformation lasts until you deliberately end it. \n\nWhile transformed, you:\n▶▶ May not speak save for grunts and howls, preventing you from completing verbal components in spells.\n\n▶▶ May bite as an unarmed strike for 1d6 piercing damage, using either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack.

After you deal damage to an enemy with a bite attack or any other unarmed strike, you may force the enemy to make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures of types other than fey, giants, and humanoids automatically succeed this saving throw. On a\nsuccess, the target suffers an additional 3d10 piercing damage. \n\nOn a failure, the target is polymorphed into a werewolf under your control for one minute, or until you lose concentration upon this effect.

As an action, you conjure a ghost in a space within 30 feet of you with hit points equal to your five times your fighter level. It disappears when it falls to 0 hit points, moves more than 30 feet away from you, you lose Concentration, or the one-minute duration of the conjuration expires. The ghost is friendly to you and your allies. Roll initiative for the ghost separately. As an action, you may give it a simple verbal command (such as “possess a specific enemy” or “always attack the nearest enemy”). If you give it no commands, or has completed the last command you gave, it uses the Help action to grant advantage to one of your attack rolls. If it uses its Possession action, that effect immediately ends if the duration of the conjuration expires. Damage that the ghost takes does not transfer to your spectral companion, but as long as the ghost is present, your spectral companion cannot guard an ally, use Companion’s Strike, or be affected in any way. \n\nStarting at 18th level, the ghost that you conjure has hit points equal to five times your fighter level." compset="ClSpecial">
