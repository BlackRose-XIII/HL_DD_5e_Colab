In any case, the Exorcism domain is never a deity&apos;s only domain, but a small and active arm of a greater Church. In rare cases, nature deities take a strong enough position against the intrusion of creatures from Outside that they consecrate a cleric with the power to banish intruders.\n\nAs paladins and many clerics defend their faith and innocents under their care against physical threats, including warfare, pestilence, and oppression, exorcists defend against spiritual threats from other planes: celestials (particularly evil or fallen angels), elementals, fey, and fiends. These enemies may manifest in subtle ways, and an exorcist must exercise great insight to root them out without destroying innocents in the process." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cHB5CImpBo" name="Improved Bomb" description="Starting at 5th level you learn how to enhance simple destructive alchemical items. This works just like your bomb ability but in addition to adding damage you can also apply one of the following effects: \n\nArea affect – you change the bomb so that instead of targeting a single target it affects an area 10ft wide. Anything caught in the blast must make a check or suffer the normal effects of the bomb.  \n\nBlinding – Creatures that are hit by the bomb must make a Constitution save (DC equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be blinded for 1 minute. \n\nDelayed - The bomb can be placed so that it explodes a number of rounds after you cease contact with it. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by you, up to a number of rounds equal to your level. If at any point you reclaim possession of the delayed bomb, you can end the timer and prevent the bomb’s detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb’s contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and half damage to all adjacent creatures (Dex save negates). You cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. You create another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel magic can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus). \n\nStinky – In addition to the normal effects, the bomb also produces a 10 foot radius cloud of noxious gas. The cloud’s area is lightly obscured. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your intelligence modifier + proficiency bonus). On a failed save the creature spends its next turn chocking and retching. This cloud lasts for 1 round.  \n\nSticky – A bomb you add the sticky affect to becomes slightly adhesive. This either produces an effect identical to a tanglefoot bag when you throw the item at a target (but only affecting the target of the attack) or makes the vial itself stick to a target, granting you advantage on the attack you make with the alchemical item (since it sticks to its target).  \n\nStarting at 10thlevel you can add two affects from this list to a single bomb. At 15thlevel you can add up to three effects from this list one bomb." compset="ClSpecial">

This discovery is chosen from the list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work. \n\nPotion of Perfected Form – You brew a single one time use potion that either increases a single mental ability score (either Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) by 2 points up to a maximum of 22, or permanently grants you advantage on all checks made with a single mental ability score (your choice). In addition this potion stops your aging process giving you eternal youth.  Grand Elixir of Regeneration – You create a onetime use elixir that grants you (only you) permanent regeneration. After imbibing the potion you regenerate 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns.  \n\nPhilosopher’s Stone – You’ve learned how to create a philosopher&apos;s stone, and can do so once per month at no cost. Creating a philosopher&apos;s stone takes 1 day of work. A Philosopher’s Stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open a cavity is revealed at the stone&apos;s heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables you to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher&apos;s stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp) before being consumed. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon. \n\nPotion of True Invisibility - You can create a potion of true invisibility and may do so once a week with no cost. A potion of true invisibility can only be used by you but once used it renders you invisible for 1 hour no matter if you attack or not. In addition while under the effects of a potion of true invisibility you are impossible to scry and it’s impossible to gain any information on you using any divination spell that is not divine in origin." compset="ClSpecial">
