In combat, this typiclaly allows for the reversal of one action or the rerolling of a failed save.\n\nEvery time the ruinstone is used, someone the wielder knows is disintegrated and erased from reality. Roll a d20: on a 5-20, it&apos;s an ally of the villain. On a 1-4, it&apos;s one of the player characters. \n\nIf a creature has bound its soul to the ruinstone, the artifact explodes on use. The creature whose soul is bound disappears from reality and can only be brought back via a {i}wish{/i} spell or similar magical effect." compset="Wondrous">

The wielder can use an action to throw the grenade up to 120 feet. It explodes at the end of the turn in which it was armed. All creatures within 60 feet of the explosion suffer from these effects;\n\n- They must make a DC 15 Dexterity save, suffering 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failure or half that on a save.\n- They must make a DC 15 Constitution save. On a failure, they suffer 28 (8d6) thunder damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. On a success they take half the damage and are not stunned\n- The wielder rolls on the chart for the wand of wonder item three times, repeating any duplicated results. Any wand effects that have a specific target instead affect everyone wtihin the grenade&apos;s range. Any wand effects that would target the wand&apos;s wielder instead affect the closest creature to the explosion.\n\nIf places in an interdimensional space or teleported, the grenade explodes. It affects all creatures within 30 feet of both the origin and the destination of the teleportation effect." compset="Wondrous">
