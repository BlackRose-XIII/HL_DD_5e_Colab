Jade dwarves were created from this stone as personification of this ability to withstand foul energies. Sometimes called “celestial” or “exalted,” jade dwarves are rare and their holds are always found bordering regions that are cursed, overrun with undead or fiends, or tainted in some other way. They are almost otherworldly in nature and consider themselves the supreme guardians of civilization and all that is good.\n\n{b}Description{/b}:\nAs a jade dwarf, your skin ranges from mint green to green-grey, and your dark eyes have no pupils. Your hair varies from brown to grey, but can also be streaked with green, or totally dark green if you are member of a noble house." compset="SubRace" uniqueness="unique">

They were the first dwarves, but the Creator abandoned them in the primordial fires, considering them a failed experiment. This slight was not forgotten, and an army of vengeful obsidian dwarves tried to overthrow their Creator. Their legion was divided by one idealistic obsidian dwarf who saw revenge as the path to total damnation; should they strike back in anger against their Creator, they would forever be seen as creatures of evil.\n\n{b}Description{/b}:\nAs an obsidian dwarf, your black skin is perfectly smooth and glassy, and flickers beautifully in firelight. Your eyes reflect your fiery heritage, like black coals or scarlet embers. Your hair may be wild and tangled, but can be dreadlocked, singed by fire, or ritually burned away." compset="SubRace" uniqueness="unique">
