  <thing id="io5CCdxKhr" name="Codex of Khiruzam" description="When a creature fails its saving throw against a damaging spell you cast, the book gains 1 charge. Whenever you roll damage for a spell you cast, you may spend 1 charge to reroll up to three damage dice. You must use the new results. The codex of Khiruzam can hold up to 8 charges; the first time in a day that it would gain a ninth charge, roll d100.\n\nOn a result of 01–05, the book blackens, turns to ash, and disintegrates over the course of 3 rounds. It reappears elsewhere in the world in 24 hours. \n\nOn a result of 06–25, the book casts fireball as a 3rd-level spell, centered on its attuned bearer. Its spell save DC is 15.\n\nOn a result of 26–100, a new spell appears in the book. You must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion) check to\ncomprehend the spell. The spell is randomly generated; roll 1d6 for its spell level and roll 1d4 to determine the spell&apos;s class list: 1, bard; 2, cleric; 3, warlock; 4, wizard. \n\nAs long as the book is attuned, you may cast spells added in this way as if they are on your class spell list. The book can hold up to six spells in this way." compset="Wondrous">

The Constitution saving throw DC to resist this disease is equal to 10 + the level of the expended spell slot. A creature that\nsucceeds a saving throw against the crimson wasting is immune to further infections for 24 hours.\n\nAdditionally, you may inscribe up to seven necromantic spells of 1st level or higher into the libram of the crimson wasting. Your spell attack rolls, spell damage rolls, and saving throw DCs for these spells receive a +2 bonus." compset="Wondrous">

Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against an illusion\nspell inscribed into this book that you cast, it takes 1d10 psychic damage. This may occur more than once per casting, if the spell allows repeated saving throws. \n\nAdditionally, the spell save DC of your illusion spells increases by 1." compset="Wondrous">

When you cast one of those spells with this book in hand, you may change its\ndamage type to lightning or thunder. If the spell normally deals lightning or thunder damage, you may instead resolve the spell as if it had been cast with a spell slot one level higher than the one you used (to a maximum of 9th level). You may use either of these benefits three times per day. These uses refresh at sunrise. While attuned to this book, you also gain advantage on saving throws against spells and\neffects dealing lightning or thunder damage." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="io5CPrphcy" name="Prophecies of Ni-shaan" description="Bound in a scroll case of glyph-protected silver, this manuscript holds the secrets to summoning and destroying demons. It holds the spells\nbanishment, dispel evil and good, gate, planar ally, planar binding, and plane shift. You may cast any of these spells that are on your spell list as if you know them. Once per day, you may treat up to one spell from this list as if it is on your class spell list; once chosen, you may not change that spell until one week has passed.\n\nOnce during any long rest, on a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, you can learn the name of a powerful demon, suitable for use with planar ally. The DC increases by 2 for each name you have previously gained in this way. On a failed Intelligence (Arcana) check, you do not recover hit points, Hit Dice, or expended spell slots from that long rest. \n\nYou gain advantage on melee spell attacks when casting dispel evil and good or plane shift to banish a demon. Whenever you deal damage to a demon while holding this scroll open in one hand, you may reroll all dice that result in a 1 or 2. You must keep the new result." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="io5CFrgLmW" name="Fragments of the Luminous Word" description="These ancient orichalcum tablets allow up to three spellcasters to attune to them simultaneously. Each attuned spellcaster treats the fragments as one item that they have attuned. Attuned spellcasters may prepare one additional spell of up to their highest spell level available, though that spell must deal fire or radiant damage and be chosen from the collective spell lists of currently attuned spellcasters. You do not need to remain in possession of one of the fragments to remain attuned to it, but you must examine at least one fragment briefly as part of any long rest that you take, or your attunement ends.\n\nWhen you cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage, you may expend one Hit Die to add it to the spell attack roll or the damage dealt.\nAdditionally, when an aberration makes a saving throw against a spell or effect you cast, it does so with disadvantage. You also gain resistance to cold damage." compset="Wondrous">
