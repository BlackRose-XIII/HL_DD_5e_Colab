  <thing id="c5COathAng" name="Oath of the Angelic Avatar" description="Angelic avatars are paladins that undergo intense conditioning to accept the physical blessings of  the divine and take vows that commit them to the machinations of the greater good, an active path of resisting evil in all its forms.\n\nAngelic Oath\nThe Angelic Oath binds a paladin to the tenets of goodness, pledging them to actively work to improve the lives of others, embody goodwill, and opposed to and completely intolerant of evil in all ways. Angelic avatars are easily distinguished from their fellow paladins, both for their staunch refusal to allow for evil and their much more visible blessings from the greater planes. \n\nThe precise way an angelic avatar undertakes the benign scope of their duties varies greatly from paladin to paladin—some fight against evil, others broker peace between warring nations, many are healers, and more are a mix of all three—but they always act in the interests of the greater good, frequently sacrificing their own well-being to aid or protect those who cannot defend or help themselves. Angelic avatars are well known for their harsh intolerance of evil, and towns these paladins settle in frequently move\nany illicit or questionable activity well away from the paladin’s gaze. \n\nPaladins who swear the Angelic Oath are utterly devoted to the gods of good, using all of their tenets as a measure of their devotion (a \ndaunting task for most). They idolize angels and strive to emulate them, modifying their bodies through intense prayer to appear more like and acquire some of the abilities of celestial beings. \n\nTenets of Angelicism\nThe constraints and expressions of the Angelic Oath may vary depending on the specific type of angel a sect is devoted to above all others, but all paladins of this oath share these principles. Health. The preservation of life is founded by the wellbeing of a creature and in addition to conditioning your body, mind, and spirit, you eat healthily, abstain from alcohol, and encourage others around you to do the same.\n\nOppose Evil. Evil cannot be allowed to exist under any circumstances. If you cannot end it now, you must do so at the earliest opportunity, and evil is never your ally.\n\nPenance. To maintain your purity any evil acts or latency of the other tenets must be expunged from your soul through suffering.\n\nPurity. Attaining the essence of an angel can allow for no tainting of the soul and any deviation from the principles of the Angelic Oath must be purged. The same is true for those to whom you’ve rendered aid.\n\nSelf-Sacrifice. Angels know that they are but gears in the machinations of benign divinity; you accept that to preserve the life of another with your own is a virtuous way to die." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">
