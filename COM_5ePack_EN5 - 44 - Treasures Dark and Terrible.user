  <thing id="i5CAegisEM" name="Aegis of the Eternal Moon" description="The circular surface of this gleaming silver shield is marked by dents and craters, like the image of a full moon. While holding this shield, you gain a magical +1 bonus to AC. This item has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each night at moonrise.\n\nWhile this shield is equipped, you may expend 1 charge as an action to cast moonbeam, with the following exceptions: the spell manifests\nas a line of moonlight 10 feet long and 5 feet wide emanating from the shield, and you may move the beam by moving the shield (no action\nrequired). When the first charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a gibbous moon and loses its magical +1 bonus to AC. When the second charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a crescent moon and becomes a buckler, granting only a +1 bonus to AC. \n\nWhen the final charge is expended, the shield fades away completely, leaving behind its polished silver handle. When the shield regains charges, it reforms according to how many charges it has remaining." compset="MagicArmor">

  <thing id="io5CCollar" name="Collar of Cerberus" description="While you wear this spiked cold iron collar, two spectral, canine heads materialize on either side of your head. Each head has a reaction and may make an opportunity attack against creatures that leave your reach. You may also command the heads to make a bite attack as an action, or allow the heads to bite in place of attacks granted by the Extra Attack feature.\n\nMelee Attack—Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.\n\nAlternatively, if you place this collar on a willing or unwilling beast, it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (as animal friendship) by you until you remove the collar. If it succeeds on this saving throw, it may still wear the collar of its own free will, but can remove it as an action. While it wears this collar, the two spectral heads materialize upon its shoulders, granting it the above attack option." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="io5CCrwnDv" name="Crown of the Devourer" description="The black arches of this foul crown are scarred with biting frost. Innumerable flies adorn its surface like grotesque gemstones, and a single\nrusted face wails silently from its iron circlet. As an action, you may choose to embody an aspect of the Devourer, a frigid avatar of entropy that feeds on heat and life. You may end a chosen aspect by removing the crown, but you cannot choose a new one until you complete a long rest.\n\nAspect of Cold Death. The ice gnawing at the crown’s iron arches spreads down your shoulders and arms, blackening your fingertips with icy decay. You gain the ability to cast chill touch as an action at-will. Once per day, you may also cast chromatic orb (+5 to hit), but you may only choose to have it deal cold damage.\n\nAspect of Dissolving Jaws. The rusted face on the center of the crown flares to life and glares with emerald eyes at your enemies as your own teeth grow sharp and pointed. You gain the ability to make a bite attack against a single target using a bonus to attack rolls equal to your Strength modifier plus your proficiency bonus, and dealing 1d6 piercing damage plus your Strength modifier. On a hit, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take additional acid damage equal to your Strength modifier. The target repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns until it succeeds.\n\nAspect of Carrion. The flies atop the crown awaken from their iron slumber and buzz hungrily about you, seeking their next meal. Up to 3 times per day when you kill a living creature, you may choose to gain 1d10 + 5 temporary hit points." compset="Wondrous">

The lantern’s candle burns for 1 minute, after which the pumpkin instantly rots and loses its magic.\n\nUndead must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw when entering the radius or when beginning their turn within the lantern’s light.
